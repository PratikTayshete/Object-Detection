# Object-Detection
A python program using ORB detection technique in opencv to detect an object using a webcam.

You can replace the sample image given with any of the image to be detected.

NOTE: We might observe some threshold value from the noise value while using the webcam. 

NOTE: The position of the image and the surrounding light effect on the image can also affect the threshold value for it
